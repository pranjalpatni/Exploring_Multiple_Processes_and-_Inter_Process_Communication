PROJECT DETAILS

CPU
   It has these registers:  PC, SP, IR, AC, X, Y.
   It supports the instructions shown on the next page of this document.
   It runs the user program at address 0.
   Instructions are fetched into the IR from memory.
   Each instruction is executed before the next instruction is fetched.
   The user stack resides at the end of user memory and grows down toward address 0.
   The system stack resides at the end of system memory and grows down toward address 0.
   There is no hardware enforcement of stack size.
   The program ends when the End instruction is executed.  The 2 processes end at that time.
   The user program cannot access system memory (exits with error message).

Memory
   It consists of 2000 integer entries, 0-999 for the user program, 1000-1999 for system code.
   It supports two operations:
       read(address) -  returns the value at the address
       write(address, data) - writes the data to the address
   Memory initializes itself by reading a program file.

 
Timer
   A timer interrupts the processor after every X instructions, where X is a command-line parameter.

Interrupt processing
   There are two forms of interrupts:  the timer and a system call using the int instruction.
   The stack is switched to the system stack.
   Registers are saved on the system stack.
   A timer interrupt causes execution at address 1000.
   The int instruction causes execution at address 1500.
   Interrupts are disabled during interrupt processing to avoid nested execution.
   The iret instruction returns from an interrupt.


Instruction set

    1 = Load value			Load the value into the AC
    2 = Load addr			Load the value at the address into the AC			
    3 = LoadInd addr			Load the value from the address found in the address into the AC		   
    4 = LoadIdxX addr			Load the value at (address+X) into the AC
    5 = LoadIdxY addr			Load the value at (address+Y) into the AC
    6 = LoadSpX				Load from (Sp+X) into the AC
    7 = Store addr			Store the value in the AC into the address
    8 = Get 				Gets a random int from 1 to 100 into the AC
    9 = Put port			If port=1, writes AC as an int to the screen
					If port=2, writes AC as a char to the screen
   10 = AddX				Add the value in X to the AC
   11 = AddY				Add the value in Y to the AC
   12 = SubX				Subtract the value in X from the AC
   13 = SubY				Subtract the value in Y from the AC
   14 = CopyToX				Copy the value in the AC to X
   15 = CopyFromX			Copy the value in X to the AC
   16 = CopyToY				Copy the value in the AC to Y
   17 = CopyFromY			Copy the value in Y to the AC
   18 = CopyToSp			Copy the value in AC to the SP
   19 = CopyFromSp   			Copy the value in SP to the AC 
   20 = Jump addr			Jump to the address
   21 = JumpIfEqual addr		Jump to the address only if the value in the AC is zero
   22 = JumpIfNotEqual addr		Jump to the address only if the value in the AC is not zero
   23 = Call addr			Push return address onto stack, jump to the address	
   24 = Ret 				Pop return address from the stack, jump to the address
   25 = IncX 				Increment the value in X
   26 = DecX 				Decrement the value in X
   27 = Push				Push AC onto stack
   28 = Pop				Pop from stack into AC
   29 = Int 				Set system mode, switch stack, push SP and PC, set new SP and PC
   30 = IRet				Restore registers, set user mode
   50 = End				End execution
